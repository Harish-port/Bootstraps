What is Garbage Collection?

JS is a garbage collector language

Garbage collection involves identifying objects that are no longer needed and releasing their memory.
Garbage collection is performed by JS engine which uses a technique called Mark and sweep alogorithm to identify and remove objects and variable that are no longer in use.




To prevent memory leaks, itâ€™s important to understand how JavaScript manages memory and what causes leaks. JavaScript is a garbage-collected language, meaning that the browser automatically frees up memory that is no longer needed by the program. However, if a program holds onto references to objects that are no longer needed, the garbage collector cannot free up that memory, leading to a memory leak.
