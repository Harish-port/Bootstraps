// In the MD Med Compass dashboard for CVS Pharmacy, one of my core contributions was implementing a cross-filtering mechanism using Apex Charts. This allowed users, such as doctors and nurses, to click on chart segments — for example, a bar in a chart representing “Pending Reports” — and instantly update tables, counts, and badges elsewhere on the dashboard in real time.

// I used React.js with Redux Toolkit for state management. On chart interaction, we dispatched an action to call a filtered API endpoint and then updated the store, which reflected across multiple components.

// We also handled edge cases, like toggling the same chart segment again to reset filters, and added loading spinners for a smooth UX. This feature significantly reduced the time users spent navigating reports and was praised by stakeholders during reviews.

//  Led, designed and delivered the initial dashboard MVP to stakeholders, which secured project funding. The subsequent success of its Phase 2 led to the acquisition of two additional projects, each valued at $50,000 showcasing the dashboard's impact and potential.
