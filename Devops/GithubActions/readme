1. what is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD toll built into GitHub that allows you to automate workflows like testing, building and deploying code based on GitHub events such as push, pull requests or releases.

2. Core Concepts (TL;DR):
Workflow – The automation file written in YAML (.github/workflows/*.yml).

Job – A group of steps run in the same environment (can run in parallel with other jobs).

Step – A single task (e.g., npm install, npm test) inside a job.

Action – A reusable function or plugin (e.g., actions/checkout, setup-node).

Runner – The machine (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted) where jobs execute.

Secret – Encrypted environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys).

Event Trigger – What starts the workflow (e.g., push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch).

Matrix – Run the same job in multiple environments (e.g., Node 14, 16, 18).

Caching – Speed up workflows by reusing dependencies (like node_modules).
