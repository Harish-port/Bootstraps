// SUMMARY

// - call(): Immediately invokes a function with the this value and arguments passed individually.

// - apply(): Immediately invokes a function with the this value, but arguments are passed as an array.

// - bind(): Returns a new function where this is bound, and it can be invoked later.

// These methods are particularly useful when borrowing methods from other objects or setting the context dynamically.
