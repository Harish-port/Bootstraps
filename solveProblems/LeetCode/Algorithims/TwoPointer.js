// What is the Two-Pointer Approach?
// The two-pointer approach is an efficient algorithm used to solve problems related to sorting, searching, and optimization. It involves using two different pointers to traverse a data structure, usually from opposite ends or different positions, to find pairs or subsets that satisfy a given condition.

// How It Works

// Sort the array (if needed) to simplify the search process.
// Use two pointers (typically left and right):
// One pointer starts at the beginning of the array.
// The other pointer starts at the end of the array.
// Move the pointers based on conditions:
// If the sum (or another condition) matches, store the result.
// If the sum is too small, move the left pointer right to increase the sum.
// If the sum is too large, move the right pointer left to decrease the sum.
